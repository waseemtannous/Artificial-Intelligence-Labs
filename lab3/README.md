## Project Grade: 100%
In this project we have solved the Minimum Graph Coloring problem which is an NP-Complete problem.
We have used the Constraints Satisfaction Problem (CSP) method to solve this problem.

Two variants of the CSP were used:
- Backtracking with Backjumping.
- Forward checking with Arc Consistency.

We have used these methods with the HD, MRV and LCV heuristics.

We have also implemented Tabu search and Genetic algorithm to solve the problem.

A thorough report was conducted and can be found in the 'documents' folder.
