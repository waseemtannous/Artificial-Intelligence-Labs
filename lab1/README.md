## Project Grade: 100%
In this project, we have implemented the concept of Genetic Algorithm in order to get to a target string
by starting from a random set of strings and mating between 2 strings to produce "children", using different crossover and mutation functions, which are then given a fitness
value and ranked. We have introduced multiple methods of selection and survival like SUS, RWS, Tournament selection and Aging.

Also, we have implemented the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to reach the same goal.

We have also generalized the Genetic Algorithm so that it would work and solve the N-Queens and Knapsack problems using the same methods stated above.

The last algorithm is Minimal Conflicts, which was used to solve the N-Queens problem.
